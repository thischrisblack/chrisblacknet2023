                <p>
                    My name is <a href="index.html">Chris Black</a>. I am a musician and composer. I play mostly double
                    bass, but I'll get involved with anything that makes a sound. I am the founder of the alt-classical
                    chamber music concert series ChamberLab. I have been a member of such groups as Shoulders (Austin,
                    TX), Les Wampas (Paris, FR), Golden Arm Trio (Austin, TX), The Wedding's Off (L.A., CA), and the
                    Taraf de Tucson (Tucson, AZ).
